# Vadarr
A new, unified platform with Nuxt 3 UI that syncs IMDB, Trakt, AniList &amp; more into Overseerr/Jellyseerr, auto-requests media, and grabs torrents via Debrid Media Manager + Real-Debrid. Tracks TV seasons/episodes, filters with regex, manages queues, logs history. No *arr stack. Docker-ready, open-source, privacy-first. One app to rule your media.
